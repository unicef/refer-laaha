00:00:00.187 --> 00:00:02.958
(airplane jet engine)

2
00:00:02.958 --> 00:00:07.474
(bright music plays)

3
00:00:09.474 --> 00:00:11.120
<v ->Really just stumbled
on them through a website

4
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.451
where they post medical
transcription jobs.

5
00:00:13.451 --> 00:00:14.821
This other company was out there,

6
00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:17.737
saying, "Hey. We're looking
for transcriptionists."

7
00:00:18.413 --> 00:00:19.670
I clicked on it.

8
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.287
Moved very quickly.

9
00:00:21.287 --> 00:00:24.385
Within less than a week,
I was already working.

10
00:00:24.385 --> 00:00:26.804
<v ->Rev is first and foremost a translation</v>

11
00:00:26.804 --> 00:00:28.692
and transcription agency

12
00:00:28.692 --> 00:00:32.221
and flexibility is extremely
important to me as a student.

13
00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:33.932
We can claim jobs as we like,

14
00:00:33.932 --> 00:00:37.020
or we can not claim jobs if
we don't have time to do them.

15
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.534
<v ->I'm getting paid to transcribe these</v>

16
00:00:41.534 --> 00:00:43.551
and I'm learning things.

17
00:00:43.551 --> 00:00:48.371
I've typed sermons, some
great, inspiring sermons.

18
00:00:48.371 --> 00:00:51.929
I'm getting to do all this
fun stuff and I'm learning

19
00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:54.287
and that is just a tremendous experience.

20
00:00:54.287 --> 00:00:56.344
<v ->I like the challenge of a word</v>

21
00:00:56.344 --> 00:00:59.003
and the most challenging part of my job

22
00:00:59.003 --> 00:01:01.647
is when I am transcribing something

23
00:01:01.647 --> 00:01:03.902
and they use a word that I don't know.

24
00:01:03.902 --> 00:01:07.003
I look it up and I want to
make sure I know what it is,

25
00:01:07.003 --> 00:01:09.187
that it fits the context of the sentence.

26
00:01:09.187 --> 00:01:11.169
Then, I try to - I do this with my kids.

27
00:01:11.169 --> 00:01:12.867
I try to use it.

28
00:01:12.867 --> 00:01:16.327
<v ->I feel like I've gotten
to know Rev as a company

29
00:01:16.327 --> 00:01:18.469
and the executives, even, at Rev

30
00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:20.854
and it's nice to have that
more personal connection,

31
00:01:20.854 --> 00:01:23.270
even though it's such a big company.

32
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:24.200
<v ->You know what?</v>

33
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.809
They're real people.

34
00:01:24.809 --> 00:01:26.371
They're real people and I like that.

35
00:01:26.371 --> 00:01:28.559
They're real people and they
treat you like a real person.

36
00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:29.945
<v ->I really was shocked.</v>

37
00:01:29.945 --> 00:01:31.287
I called my husband and said,

38
00:01:31.287 --> 00:01:32.390
"Hey, not only did I get a job,

39
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.453
"but I've already earned money today.

40
00:01:33.453 --> 00:01:34.772
"What do you think of that?"

41
00:01:34.772 --> 00:01:38.321
You're always leery
about anything that says,

42
00:01:38.321 --> 00:01:39.298
"Work from home."

43
00:01:39.298 --> 00:01:41.390
It's got a negative connotation to it

44
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.000
and everybody thinks it's a scam,

45
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.871
but Rev is not.

46
00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:45.745
It's not a scam.

47
00:01:45.745 --> 00:01:47.160
I truly get paid every week,

48
00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.871
which is also fantastic.

49
00:01:49.871 --> 00:01:52.253
<v ->I did recently purchase
a house in Urbana

50
00:01:52.253 --> 00:01:54.790
and that was a big commitment,

51
00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.999
a large part of which was
financed by my work with Rev.

52
00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:03.541
It's been great, not only in the
here and the now for the income,

53
00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:06.650
but also as a professional
development thing.

54
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.957
It's invaluable, as far
as what it's going to do

55
00:02:08.957 --> 00:02:11.484
for my job security and my options

56
00:02:11.484 --> 00:02:15.882
when I get out of school and
start looking for full time work.

57
00:02:15.882 --> 00:02:19.000
<v ->I don't miss school
appointments or school plays

58
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.520
or that kind of thing.

59
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.867
We don't miss soccer practice,
we don't miss soccer games.

60
00:02:22.867 --> 00:02:26.717
Those are benefits that
you can't get in an office.

61
00:02:26.717 --> 00:02:28.466
<v ->I get to work for a living,</v>

62
00:02:28.466 --> 00:02:30.919
earn some money, work
for a company I like,

63
00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:34.887
and pursue my passion, which is writing.

64
00:02:34.887 --> 00:02:37.647
I'm not sure how it can
get much better than that.

65
00:02:37.647 --> 00:02:42.647
